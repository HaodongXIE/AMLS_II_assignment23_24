To run the code, you first need to download the dataset provided on [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) and put them under the folder "/Datasets"

After downloading dataset (around 6GB), you can run main.py or notebook.ipynb to reproduce the results.


To conduct the CNN task, you simply need to replace the ResNet50 in main.py with CNN model defined in folder A.
